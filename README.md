Gesture Definition:
 Based on the work, it is possible to define a general framework that 
consider gestures from the viewpoint of communication, control and 
metaphor. Communication is involved when gesture work as vehicles of 
meaning in social interaction. This use of the term is common int linguistics, 
behavioral psychology, and social anthropology. Control is involved when 
gestures work as element of a system, such as in the control of 
computational and interactive systems. This is common in the fields of 
human-computer interaction(HCI). Computer music, and similar areas. 
Metaphor is involved when gestures work as concepts that project physical 
movement, sound, or other types of perception to cultural topics. This use
